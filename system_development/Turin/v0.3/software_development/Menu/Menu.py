Goals:
    - Make an menu to allow for selection of different .exe's 
    - Will allow for faster testing and better user expierence 

ToDo:
    1) Finish Streaming
    2) Add more as needed

Doc:
    - tkinter: https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html
    - CSV new header: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51463449/replace-csv-header-without-deleting-the-other-rows
